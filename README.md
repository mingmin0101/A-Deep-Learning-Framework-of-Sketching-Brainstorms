## Abstract
To catch fast-moving trends and increase customer engagement, businesses often employ the brainstorming technique to develop innovative ideas, find appropriate solutions to problems, and make strategic decisions for satisfying the needs of customers. The outcome of brainstorming or idea generation may be often presented by a sequence of sketches for showing a concept or process flow. Deriving the layout wireframes from those sketches may bridge the gap in communicating with others during brainstorming sessions and depict the concept or process flow for further design and implementation. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study dedicated to generating the layouts from a sequence of sketches. Therefore, we propose a framework to generate the wireframes from a sequence of sketches. Our proposed framework contains four phases. First, we detect the components in each sketch of the input sequence and derive the spatial and directional relationships between components. Second, we utilize the relational graph convolutional networks to aggregate the node features through the derived spatial and directional relationships. Third, we devise a wireframe layout model to generate the layout of each sketch by using three attention mechanisms namely, state, inner-sketch, and across-sketch. Finally, we develop a rendering module to generate the wireframes for the input sketch sequence. The experimental results show that our proposed framework outperforms the comparing methods, and can generate the layout wireframes not only accurately convey the information of the spatial and directional alignment but are also close to the real applications. The proposed framework may help businesses convert their ideas from sketches to wireframes during brainstorming and speed up their design processes in a timely and cost-efficient manner, which in turn help business catch up with the opportunities in the market.
